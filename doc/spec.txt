You're free to choose any language you'd like, so long as we can run it on Ubuntu 9.04 without installing 3rd-party (non-apt get) packages.  Please write your code as if this were a component of a production system that will be heavily used and maintained (as opposed to a contest problem).  If you don't have enough time to do the client/service part of the problem, we would also accept an interactive program.

Design and implement a calculator service and a client that sends arithmetic expressions to the service and get results back.

(1) An arithmetic expression is a string that may contain integers, "+", "*", "(" and ")". Its result is also an integer.
(2) Clients and the service may run on different machines.
(3) The interface between the client and the service is open to any design.
(4) The service should be able to handle concurrent requests and take throughput and availability into consideration.

Examples:

Input: (2+3)*(1+4)
Output: 25

Input: 3**2
Output: error - invalid operator

Input: 3*(2+1
Output: error - miss-matched parenthesis

Please submit:

(1) Brief description about the design, implementation and performance analysis.
(2) Source code of the service and the client and instructions to compile and run both of them.
